Files are created, updated and commited to the local develop branch.

Local testing must take place to ensure the "develop" code is functional.

Once tested, the develop code should be merged into the master branch.
Merging is NOT performed locally but through a GitHub Pull Request.

First one pushes the [develop] branch to GitHub (origin)
Next, on the GitHub page, a pull request is created:
   base: master <- compare: develop    [Create pull request]
