Files are created, updated and commited to the local develop branch.

Local testing must take place to ensure the "develop" code is functional.

Once tested, the develop code should be merged into the master branch.
Merging is NOT performed locally but through a GitHub Pull Request.

First one pushes the [develop] branch to GitHub (origin)
Next, on the GitHub page, a pull request is created:
   base: master <- compare: develop    [Create pull request]

The pull request should then be accepted (or rejected) by an authorized GitHub user.
 - Merge commit adds all commits to the [master] branch
 - Squash merge embeds all submitted commits into one before committing
   to the [master] branch, resulting in a clearer master branch history
NOTE: SQUASH merge should be performed on [head] branches, that are removed
right after merging.
Persisting branches commits, like in [develop], should be merge commited.
